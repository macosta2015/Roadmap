# Roadmap
####### This is the Challenge9 of the repository. 

## Using SQLite
#### SQLite is a good tool because it does work that SQL does but in a more efficient way. It is able to store data in a smaller way. We are getting our data from our resources folder

## Flask
#### Flask is a new tool to create a webapplication. We are using our local host so that we can display this data. 
### The following is the code used in terminal. We then need to copy the address and past is on the search bar of the browser.

#### The ideal work is that with this information becomes visually friendly. At the ends what we did was to retrive the data from a month with a query. Then convert this into the list. From the list to a dataframe. Then we use "df" so that we get the details of the month.
